## VFTools - Tools for VirtualFlow


Welcome to the VirtualFlow project!

VirtualFlow is a versatile, parallel workflow platform for carrying out virtual screening related tasks on Linux-based computer clusters of any type and size which are managed by a batchsystem (such as SLURM). 

Currently, there exist two versions of VirtualFlow, which are tailored to different types of tasks:

- [VFLP: VirtualFlow for Ligand Preparation](https://github.com/VirtualFlow/VFLP)
- [VFVS : VirtualFlow for Virtual Screenings](https://github.com/VirtualFlow/VFVS)


VFTools is a a loose collection of additional tools and scripts which can be useful when using VirtualFlow, for example for preparing workflows or postprocessing completed workflows.
